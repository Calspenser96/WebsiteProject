<h1>Hvar - Croatia</h1> 

<h2> During my time in Hvar we spent a lot of time exploring the islands beaches and driving round the island on mopeds, at night time we went to the various clubs... one called Capre Diem and the only way you could get there was by boat which run from 11pm unitl 6am.</h2>

<p>Hvar is a port and resort town on the Croatian island of Hvar. Yachts fill its harbor in summer. Ferries connect the town with the several Pakleni Islands just offshore. These are home to secluded beaches, such as those around Å½drilca Bay, as well as rocky coves and pine forests. Hula Hula Beach in Hvar and Stipanska Beach on Marinkovac Island are known for their nightlife and lively bars.</p>
